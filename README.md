# mintablelite

This is an API service that is created to help user do 3 main things, create nft,view their nfts created and show details of a nft.
I have integrated the mintology api for the minting part only.The other services involve querying the database and getting the results.The database used here is documentDB and I have deployed the api endpoints using serverless lambda functions and API gateway.
